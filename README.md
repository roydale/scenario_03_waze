Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine-learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Wazeâ€™s business.
